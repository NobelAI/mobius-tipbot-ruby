          Hi, @%{username}, I am Mobius TipBot!


          /balance will show your earned tips amount.


          /withdraw <address> <amount> will withdraw accumulated tips to your Stellar account. Omit amount to withdraw all the tips at once


          Use http://stellarterm.com to create one if you do not have it yet!


          /register <address> <amount> - if you want to tip users from your own Stellar account, use this command. `<address>` - is your Stellar address, it will be used to fund your deposit account in bot. Deposit will be funded with `<amount>`


          /my_address - returns your deposit address, that was created after /register command invocation, so you will be able to fund it any way convenient to you
