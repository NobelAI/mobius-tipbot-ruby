Mobius TipBot
=============

Easily transfer small amount of MOBI between team members of your Telegram group.

## Installation

1. Setup Stellar accounts.

   TipBot needs two accounts:

   * Source pool containing tips to be spent.
   * TipBot account holding tips awaiting for withdrawal.

   TipBot account must be added as cosigner to source pool. It must be able to make payments from source address.

   You can setup test network accounts using `mobius-cli` tool from [mobius-client-ruby](https://github.com/mobius-network/mobius-client-ruby) or [Stellar Laboratory](https://stellar.org/laboratory).

2. Setup Telegram bot.

   * Obtain token using BotFather.
   * Setup Redis and get credentials.
   * Deploy it somewhere (take a look on [sample K8s deployment](deploy/deployment.yaml), and [Dockerfile](Dockerfile))

   Environment variables are:

   * `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_REDIS_URL` - Redis URL
   * `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_TOKEN` - Telegram token.
   * `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_CREDIT_ADDRESS` - Stellar address of source pool.
   * `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` - Private key of TipBot account.
   * `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_RATE` - Tip amount.
   * `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_NETWORK` - "public" or "test", Stellar network to use.
   * `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_ASSET_CODE` - custom Stellar asset for tips. Should be in Alphanumeric 4-character maximum format. Default is MOBI.
   * `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_ASSET_ISSUER` - custom Stellar asset issuer address

   **Note** `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_ASSET_CODE` and `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_ASSET_ISSUER` should be provided together. Otherwise defaults will be used silently.

## Usage

Add TipBot to your Telegram group. It *must* be supergroup and bot must have privacy mode disabled.

TipBot supports following commands:
* `/tip` - reply to any message in your chat. This will display keyboard and current tip stats.
* `/balance` - this will show your tip balance (works in DM only).
* `/withdraw <address> <amount>` - this will send <amount> of your collected tips to following Stellar address. If <amount> is omitted, all of your tips will be withdrawn. Works in DM only.
* `/register <address> <amount>` - if you want to tip users from your own Stellar account, use this command. `<address>`
  - is your Stellar address, it will be used to fund your deposit account in bot. Deposit will be funded with `<amount>`
* `/my_address` - returns your deposit address, that was created after `/register` command invocation, so you will be
  able to fund it any way convenient to you

### Using custom Stellar assets

TipBot allows you to use custom Stellar asset instead of MOBI for tips. To achieve this set env variables `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_ASSET_CODE` and `MOBIUS_TIPBOT_ASSET_ISSUER`, and don't forget to create trustlines for your asset in source pool account and TipBot account

## Planned features

* Using accounts provided by users to send tips.
* Slack support.
* Dynamical change of tip rate using special command.
